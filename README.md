# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
In this project I created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI with Data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Solutions
This is accomplished with the use of NODE.js, used in the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` files. Element references in `index.html` are used to dynamically update the GUI, and the design is tailored with the use of `style.css` for some customization.

The weather can be requested for US Zip codes and alongside the temperature data a feelings entry is created and displayed. The requested temperature is given in degree C.

Additionally, in a second part of the weather app, requests can be made for german zip codes (e.g. 73733, 65824, 85049). Again, alongside the temperature data a feelings entry may be created and displayed. The requested temperature is given in degree C.
